    title: "Link an author to a blog post using its CID"
    type: "code"
---

In the [Basics](/basics/02) tutorial, we learned that a link in IPFS is represented as an instance of `CID`:

```javascript
{
  linkToAwesomeNode: awesomeCid
}
```
When we give a field a name and make its value a link to a CID, we call this a **named link**.

The challenge below has some prepared code to get us started. The data structure resembles a blog which has two authors, Nat and Sam, and some blog posts about trees and computers. At the moment there’s no relation between them. Let’s update the blog posts so that they link to the author.
