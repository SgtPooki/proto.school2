Let's see `files.ls` in action! List the contents of your root directory ( `/` ).

_Note: We've already included the code for adding your files to MFS, so you can
focus on listing the contents of your directory._

**Hint**: Don't forget that `files.ls` returns an Async Iterable, so you'll need to either use the `for await...of` loop or the `all` function to return the result.
