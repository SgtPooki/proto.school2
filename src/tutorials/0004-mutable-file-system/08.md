MFS allows you to move files between directories just as you would on your local machine, using the [`files.mv`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md#ipfsfilesmvfrom-to-options) method.

The method looks like this:

```js
await ipfs.files.mv(from, to, [options])
```

`from` is the source path (or paths) of the content you'd like to move. `to` is the destination path.

If your destination path references parent directories that don't already exist, you'll need to use the `{ parents: true }` option, just as you did with `files.mkdir`.

You can use `files.mv` to perform a number of different operations:

```js
// move a single file into a directory
await ipfs.files.mv('/source-file.txt', '/destination-directory')

// move a directory into another directory
await ipfs.files.mv('/source-directory', '/destination-directory')

// overwrite the contents of a destination file with the contents of a source file
await ipfs.files.mv('/source-file.txt', '/destination-file.txt')
```

To move multiple files into a directory, you can add multiple source paths before the `to` argument:

```js
// move multiple files into a directory
await ipfs.files.mv('/source-file-1.txt', '/source-file-2.txt', '/source-file-3.txt', '/destination-directory')
```

If you're starting with an array of source paths, you can use JavaScript's [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) to expand its elements into the required format:

```js
await ipfs.files.mv(...fromArray, '/destination-directory')
```
