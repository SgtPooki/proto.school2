Occasionally, a hashing algorithm may be proven to be insecure, meaning it no longer complies with the characteristics that we defined earlier. This has already happened with `sha1`. With time, other algorithms may prove to be insufficient for content addressing in IPFS and other distributed information systems. For this reason, and in order to support multiple cryptographic algorithms, **we need to be able to know which algorithm was used to generate the hash** of specific content.

So how can we do this?
To support multiple hashing algorithms, we use **multihash**.

## Multihash format

A [**multihash**](https://multiformats.io/multihash/) is a self-describing hash which itself contains metadata that describes both its length and what cryptographic algorithm generated it. Multiformats CIDs are future-proof because they use multihash to
**support multiple hashing algorithms** rather than relying on a specific one.

Multihashes follow the `TLV` pattern (`type-length-value`). Essentially, the "original hash" is prefixed with the `type` of hashing algorithm applied and the `length` of the hash.

 - `type`: identifier of the **cryptographic algorithm** used to generate the hash (e.g. the identifier of `sha2-256` would be `18` - `0x12` in hexadecimal) - see the [multicodec table](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv) for all the identifiers
 - `length`: the actual **length** of the hash (using `sha2-256` it would be `256` bits, which equates to 32 bytes)
 - `value`: the actual **hash value**

In order to represent a CID as a compact string instead of plain binary (a series of `1`s and `0`s), we can use **base encoding**. When IPFS was first created, it used `base58btc` encoding to create CIDs that looked like this:

`QmY7Yh4UquoXHLPFo2XbhXkhBvFoPwmQUSa92pxnxjQuPU`

Multihash formatting and `base58btc` encoding enabled this first version of the CID, now referred to as Version 0 (`CIDv0`), and its initial `Qm...` characters remain easy to spot.

However, with time, doubts arose about whether this multihash format would be sufficient:
 - How do we know what method was used to encode the data?
 - How do we know what method was used to create the string representation of the CID? Will we always be using `base58btc`?

To address these concerns, an evolution to the next version of a CID was necessary. In the following lessons we'll explore what was added to the specification to lead us to the current CID version: `CIDv1`.
