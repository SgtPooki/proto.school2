Once compressed, the key data needed to verify storage is stored on the Filecoin chain, a copy of which is maintained by each user running a node. This allows for Proof of Spacetime to run regularly over time.

As a storage client, you can run the `lotus client list-deals` command to list all of the storage deals proposed from that node. For example, here are the results from a node from which only one deal has been proposed:

```
$ lotus client list-deals

DealCid:    bafyreiefvrrv5j7omqzfersogg4nqzctyzj66rcmkwkbxxx5prvd5sklci
DealId:     2
Provider:   t01000
State:      StorageDealActive
On Chain?:  Y (epoch 59)
Slashed?:   N
PieceCID:   bafk4chzazx6u4luj34azuit37rlylgrcbgkaakqsjt5avsbolxale2igii3q
Size:       1016
Price:      1000000
Duration:   2744
```

Let's explore the data made available by this command:
- **DealCid**: Content identifier (CID) for the deal proposal.
- **DealId**: A unique ID for the deal.
- **Provider**: A unique identifier for the storage provider with whom the deal was made, also known as a storage miner.
- **State**: The state of the deal. This will most often be `StorageDealActive` once the data is stored and sealed. (Note that currently this will stay as `StorageDealActive` even after the duration of the deal expires or the miner fails a Proof of Spacetime, so it's important to refer to the `slashed` field for the latter case.)
- **On Chain?**: A boolean indicating whether the deal has been stored on the chain. If positive, this field will also indicate the epoch in which the data was stored. An epoch is a specific point on the chain. Lower numbers are further back in the history of the chain, while higher numbers are more recent.
- **Slashed?**: A boolean indicating whether the storage provider has failed a Proof of Spacetime. (If the miner stops storing your data, this value will change to `Y` and the miner will be penalized.)
- **PieceCID**: A CID (Content Identifier) representing the stored data, also known as CommP (Piece Commitment)
- **Size**: The bytes of data being stored.
- **Price**: The price per epoch in Filecoin Token (FIL) for the storage deal.
- **Duration**: The total duration of the agreed deal in epochs (one iteration of the blockchain, currently equivalent to 30 seconds.

## Compare these deals

For the quiz below, consider the following three deals:

```
