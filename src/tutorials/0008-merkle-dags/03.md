Before we can create content-addressable data structures, we have
to define those structures in a way that enables us to talk about
them precisely and unambiguously. For this purpose, we turn to graphs.

A *graph* is a mathematical abstraction that is used to represent
relationships among a collection of objects. It is common to use
the term *node* to refer to an object in a graph, and the term *edge*
to refer to a relation among objects. Most commonly, graphs are
used to represent pairwise relationships between objects. For
example, a graph might be used to map the roads connecting pairs
of cities, or the friendships between students in a school.

The example file hierarchy we introduced in the previous lesson
also forms a graph (the directories and files act as our nodes,
and the relationship between a directory and the files it
contains gives us our edges). We’ve depicted it again in the
figure below:

Given a graph, we can imagine starting at a node and moving along
its edges to get to another node. For example, we might start at
the root directory, "pics", in the figure above, and
progressively move deeper into the hierarchy to reach a desired
file.

## Directed Graphs

A graph is called *directed* if each edge has some sense of
direction. In the figure above, for example, edges represent
containment: a directory contains a file, but a file does not
contain its directory. The relationships between nodes only
properly associate in one direction, and this direction is
indicated by a single-headed arrow. Genealogical terms like
*ancestor*, *descendent*, *parent* and *child* are frequently used to
refer to the nodes in a directed graph. For example, in our
figure, the node corresponding to the "cats" directory would be
said to be parent to the two file nodes it contains.

Nodes that have no parents are frequently called *root* nodes,
while those without children are called *leaf* nodes. Nodes with
both parents and children are called *intermediate* nodes, as
they lie between the graph’s roots and leaves. It’s also common
to use the term *non-leaf* to refer to both intermediate nodes
and root nodes.

## Acyclic Graphs

A graph is called *acyclic* if there are no loops in the graph -
i.e., given any node in the graph, there is no way to navigate from
that node back to itself along the graph’s edges. In a directed
graph like our file hierarchy, we can only move from parent
nodes to child nodes.

## Directed Acyclic Graphs

A graph that is both directed and acyclic is called,
appropriately enough, a *directed acyclic graph*. It turns out,
these are a very commonly studied structure&mdash;so common, in fact,
that the acronym DAG is frequently used to refer to them!
Hierarchical data in particular is very naturally represented via
DAGs.
