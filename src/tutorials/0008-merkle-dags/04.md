    title: "Introducing Merkle DAGs"
    type: "multiple-choice"

When we represent graphs on a computer, we don’t have the luxury
of drawing arrows; we have to encode our data structure by
providing a concrete representation of its nodes and edges. Since
CIDs can uniquely identify a node, we can use them to express an
edge from one node to another. By doing so we create a
special sort of DAG known as a Merkle DAG, in honor of the
researcher who first described such structures. (Any graph
representation that utilizes content addressing in this way is
necessarily a DAG, as we’ll soon see).

Let’s take a look at how we can build a Merkle DAG, again using
our file directory as an example. The first step is to encode the
leaf nodes of our graph&mdash;in this case our image files&mdash;and
give each of them a CID.

For this example, we’ll simplify the representation of these
nodes to two attributes: the name of the file, and the data
corresponding to the file’s contents. These attributes, bundled
together, make up the data of our node, represented below in the
orange box.

The node's contents include the name of the corresponding file, &quot;freshwater.png&quot;, as well as the file's contents, represented in this image as a freshwater fish emoji. The node is labeled with a CID of &quot;baf...1&quot;." style="width:300px;"></div>

The label above the node is a simplified representation of the
unique CID that’s derived by passing the data of node itself
through our cryptographic hashing algorithm. (For an in-depth
look at the formatting of a CID, visit our [Anatomy of a CID](https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid)
tutorial.) Note that this label is not a part of the node itself.

We can begin building our Merkle DAG by creating its leaf nodes
first&mdash;one node for every file in our hierarchy&mdash;labelling
each with its unique CID:

![This image depicts a leaf node for each file in the example hierarchy. The nodes correspond to "freshwater.png", "tropical.png", "blowfish.png", "tabby.png", and "black.png", respectively, and are labled "baf...1" to "baf...5".](/tutorial-assets/T0008L04-leaf-nodes.svg)

The node structure for our intermediate nodes&mdash;the
subdirectories of our hierarchy&mdash;has to be a little bit
different. Each of these nodes will also contain a name,
corresponding to the name of the directory; however, the
"content" of a directory node is the list of files and
directories it contains, rather than the content of any specific
file. We can represent this as a list of CIDs, each of which
links to another node in the graph. This list, together with the
name of the directory, constitutes the data for these nodes, and
from this data we can again derive a CID, as shown below:

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/tutorial-assets/T0008L04-partial-dag.svg" alt="A Merkle DAG displaying the &quot;cats&quot; directory. The node for &quot;cats&quot; is labeled &quot;baf...7&quot;; it embeds the CIDs of the nodes corresponding to cat images (&quot;baf...4&quot; for &quot;tabby.png&quot; and &quot;baf...5&quot; for &quot;black.png&quot;). Single-headed arrows are drawn from the &quot;cats&quot; node to the child nodes." style="width:600px"></div>

In this figure, the "cats" subdirectory is represented as a very
small DAG. The node with the CID "baf...7" links to the nodes
that constitute its children, "baf...4" and "baf...5", by
embedding their CIDs in its own representation.

Now that we’ve derived representations for both types of nodes in
our graph, we can continue to build the graph from the bottom up:

![A complete Merkle DAG for the example hierarchy. The node for the "fish" folder is labeled "baf...6", the node for the "cats" folder is labeled "baf...7", and the node for the "pics" folder is labeled "baf...8". All nodes are drawn as described in the previous images.](/tutorial-assets/T0008L04-complete-dag.svg)

In a Merkle DAG, each node’s CID depends on every single one of
its descendents; should any of those be different, their own
labels would also be different. If, for example, the picture of a
tabby cat were photoshopped in some way, then its respective node
in the graph would receive a different CID. Because the CID of a
child node is part of the data of its parent, that parent&mdash;in
this case the "cats" directory&mdash;would itself change, causing
it to receive a new CID as well. In turn, the CID of the node
for the "pics" directory would also change. This means that we
*always* have to build a DAG from the bottom up: parent nodes
cannot be created until CIDs of their children can be determined.

In general, any change to a node in a Merkle DAG is propagated to
each of the changed node’s ancestors. However, a change made in
one branch of the DAG won’t force a change in the CIDs of nodes
in other branches; a node’s CID only changes in response to a
change in its own data or that of its descendents. For example,
changing "blowfish.png" doesn’t require baf...1, baf...2,
baf...4, baf...5, or baf...7 to change.

Note that structures made of nodes that embed the CIDs of their
children necessarily cannot contain cycles. The cryptographic
functions used in the construction of CIDs and therefore our
Merkle DAG make it impossible to describe a "self-referential"
path through the graph. This is an important security guarantee:
if we traverse a Merkle DAG, we can be certain that we won’t end
up in an infinite loop.

Now that we’ve seen how to use CIDs to create structured data,
let’s examine some of the properties of Merkle DAGs that we can
rely upon!
