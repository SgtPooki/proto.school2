**Peer** - A participant in a decentralized network. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. In IPFS, when you load up the IPFS Desktop app on your laptop or run `ipfs daemon` from the command line, your device becomes a peer in the decentralized network that is IPFS.

**Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** -   A decentralized network in which workloads are shared between peers. So in IPFS, each peer might host full or partial files to be shared with other peers. When one peer requests files, any peer that has chunks of those files can participate in the sending requested files. And then, the peer who request the data can later on share the data with other peers.
